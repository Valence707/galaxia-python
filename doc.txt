This could be a 2D open-world game where the player collects resources, builds stuff, and constantly tries to reach new heights.
Progression, adventure, technology, combat, building, music. Everything.

to-do:
    > Add day / night
    > Add block brightness / lighting effects 
        > draw dark surfaces over tiles and in air, only on drawn tiles (if tile is on screen)

    > Add player spawn generation to world generator
    > Add inventory
    > Add item collection and dropping
    > Add chests
    > Add furnaces
    > Add ore ingots
    > Add player armor

    > Add enemies
    > Add more accurate physics (implement Pymunk)

    > Add biomes
        > Ocean
        > Forest
        > Plains
        > Snow
        > Desert
        > Mountains

    > Make world round (player can walk 'around' the world)
    > Add option to create worlds and players and save them / rename them and stuff
    > Optimize chunk loading.

Log:
2022-7-18:
    > For the past two weeks, I've created the ability to traverse a chunk-based procedurally-generated world that is saved in a chunk map.

2022-7-25:
    > Did a ton of optimization for chunks / rendering.
    > Created world generator
    > Established framerate independence
    > Made framerate independence pixel-precise

2022-7-26:
    > Made collision detection functional at all framerates (collision detection works for changes in position greater than tile sizes)
    > Modified jumping (jumping is now a velocity assignment rather than an increment)
    > Added simple caves

2022-7-28:
    > Added Coal, Copper, Iron, and Gold textures and natural generation.
    > Optimized rendering of chunks

2023-6-30:
    > Uploaded everything to Github.
    > Added virtual environment to project.
