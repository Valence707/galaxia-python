This could be a 2D open-world game where the player collects resources, builds stuff, and constantly tries to reach new heights.
Progression, adventure, technology, combat, building, music. Everything.
To-do:
    Add day / night
    Add block brightness / lighting effects 
        draw dark surfaces over tiles and in air, only on drawn tiles (if tile is on screen)

    Add player spawn generation to world generator
    Add inventory
    Add item collection and dropping
    Add chests
    Add furnaces
    Add ore ingots
    Add player armor

    Add enemies
    Add more accurate physics
        Gravity

    Add biomes
        Ocean
        Forest
        Plains
        Snow
        Desert
        Mountains

    Make world round (player can walk 'around' the world)
    Add option to create worlds and players and save them / rename them and stuff
    Add animations based on player's position in world
    Slow down chunk loading to eliminate lag spikes

Log:
2022-7-18:
    For the past two weeks, I've created the ability to traverse a chunk-based procedurally-generated world that is saved in a chunk map.

2022-7-25:
    Did a ton of optimization for chunks / rendering.
    Created world generator
    Established framerate independence
    Made framerate independence pixel-precise

2022-7-26:
    Made collision detection functional at all framerates (collision detection works for changes in position greater than tile sizes)
    Modified jumping (jumping is now a velocity assignment rather than an increment)
    Added simple caves

2022-7-28:
    Added Coal, Copper, Iron, and Gold textures and natural generation.
    Optimized rendering of chunks
